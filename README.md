## Assignment 3 - Mengyang Guo

Here's A link to a running instance of my Shiny app: <https://mengyangguo.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-mengyangbillyguo/>

I choose: Option A - BC Liquor app

A description of my app: I updated the BC Liquor app by adding five new features

-   First, I added an image of the BC Liquor Store to the page. This makes the page looks more attractive.

-   Second, since I have both a plot and a table, I place them in separate tabs. This makes the information more organized.

-   Third, I added an option "Show result by type" that allow the user to decide whether to view result in the graph by liquor type.

-   Forth, I added an option "Show Canadian liquor ONLY" that allow the user to decide whether to only view Canadian liquor in the graph.

-   Fifth, I used the DT package to turn a static table into an interactive table.
